Morgan analysts noted Thursday's selloff suggests that \"investors were left wanting more, which we think is tied to continued uncertainty around the growth trajectory for NVDA's data center business in CY27, given massively expanded capex budgets for key customers.\"Shares of smaller rival AMD, which just clinched a deal to sell chips to Meta Platforms, were also lower in Thursday morning trading.",
