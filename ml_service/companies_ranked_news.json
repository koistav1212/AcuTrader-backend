I think we've kind of gotten to a realization that software isn't dead, and that's evidenced by a deal that was announced yesterday, Anthropic actually working directly with Microsoft, giving them 10 new plug-ins to some of their programming that Microsoft can then use in their agentic platform on the Azure cloud business.\u201dStocks on the move Wednesday included AI powerhouse Nvidia, whose quarterly results have become a focal point for investors. Shares of the chipmaker closed almost a percent and a half higher and climbed further in extended trading after the company forecast first-quarter revenue above market estimates.Other movers included taser-maker Axon Enterprise, which jumped more than 17% after the company beat fourth-quarter profit estimates.On the flip side, shares of GoDaddy tumbled more than 14% after the internet services provider forecast annual revenue below Wall Street expectations.",
